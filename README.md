# Kubernetes with Rust, MicroK8s, and cert-manager

This project demonstrates a [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster managed with [**MicroK8s**](https://microk8s.io/) and integrates a [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) application that interacts with the Kubernetes API using [**Tokio**](https://tokio.rs/) and the [**kube**](https://kube.rs/) crate. The setup includes a sample deployment, service, and Ingress configuration with [**NGINX**](https://nginx.org/), utilizing [**cert-manager**](https://cert-manager.io/) for managing TLS certificates. By leveraging MicroK8s as a local Kubernetes environment, this project provides a streamlined, lightweight solution for developing and testing Kubernetes-integrated applications, making it particularly useful for creating a local staging environment to prototype features or validate configurations before deploying to production.

The Rust app connects to the Kubernetes cluster and lists all Pods in the default namespace. This app can be extended with additional capabilities, such as:

- **Pod Management**: Create, delete, or monitor Pods programmatically.
- **Log Streaming**: Fetch and stream logs from running Pods for debugging.
- **Resource Management**: Manage ConfigMaps, Secrets, Deployments, Services, and Ingresses dynamically.
- **Metrics and Observability**: Collect and aggregate resource usage metrics (CPU, memory) and monitor the health of workloads and cluster events.
- **Automated Scaling**: Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling or Cluster Autoscaling based on real-time load.
- **Security Auditing**: Monitor Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), enforce policies, and rotate Secrets.
- **Custom Resource Management**: Extend Kubernetes with Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and automate tasks with Operators.
- **Event-Driven Automation**: Trigger app actions based on Kubernetes events or webhooks.
- **API Gateway Features**: Add traffic shaping, rate-limiting, authentication, and load balancing for your services.
- **Downtime Recovery**: Automate resource backups and implement recovery mechanisms for downtime scenarios.
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Manage namespaces, set quotas, and isolate resources for different teams or applications.
