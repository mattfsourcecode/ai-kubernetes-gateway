# Kubernetes with Rust, MicroK8s, cert-manager, Gateway API, and LocalAI

This repository demonstrates a [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster managed with [**MicroK8s**](https://microk8s.io/), integrating a [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) application that interacts with the Kubernetes API using [**Tokio**](https://tokio.rs/) and the [**kube**](https://kube.rs/) crate. It features modern service networking with the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/), TLS certificate management via [**cert-manager**](https://cert-manager.io/), and AI capabilities using [**LocalAI**](https://localai.io/).

## ⚠️ Development-Only Notice

These local Kubernetes deployments use TLS certificates created by a `selfsigned-issuer`, which are suitable for testing only and NOT intended for production use cases. A transition to a production-grade setup would require using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or another trusted certificate authority.

## Features

- **Gateway API**: Next-generation service networking with HTTPRoute for granular traffic control and TLS.
- **Cert-Manager**: Automates TLS certificate issuance using a `selfsigned-issuer` for development environments.
- **Rust Application**: A minimal implementation demonstrating [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/) interaction by listing Pods across all namespaces with their statuses, serving as a foundation for building advanced cluster operations such as pod management, resource monitoring, CRD handling, event watching, and multi-cluster management.
- **LocalAI**: Self-hosted AI capabilities with persistent storage for models, offering potential for privacy-focused, scalable, and cost-efficient AI model deployment.

## Direction

This project showcases an educational and experimental setup, offering a starting point for advanced use cases. Here are some possibilities:

- **Production-Grade TLS Certificates**: Transition to production-ready deployments by integrating trusted certificate authorities like Let's Encrypt or custom enterprise CAs for secure and scalable HTTPS traffic management.
- **Dynamic Cluster Management**: Automate scaling, monitoring, and resource optimization across multiple clusters.
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)**: Implement and manage custom Kubernetes resources tailored to specific application requirements.
- **Event-Driven Automation**: Extend the Rust app to respond to Kubernetes events or webhooks for real-time cluster adjustments.
- **AI Workload Orchestration**: Use LocalAI to manage and deploy advanced AI models for edge computing, predictive analytics, or machine learning tasks.
- **Security Enhancements**: Integrate advanced authentication mechanisms and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies for secure multi-user environments.
- **Multi-Tenancy Support**: Enable resource isolation and quota management for multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters.
- **Advanced Networking**: Leverage Gateway API features for traffic splitting, failover mechanisms, and routing policies based on performance metrics.
- **Hybrid Cloud Deployments**: Adapt the setup for hybrid or multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Implement AI-powered features such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, or chatbot functionality for applications requiring language understanding.
- **Image and Video Processing**: Use AI models to enable facial recognition, object detection, image classification, or video analytics for multimedia applications.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Leverage AI for forecasting trends, optimizing business operations, or detecting anomalies in datasets for finance, healthcare, or logistics.
- **Custom AI Model Training**: Train and fine-tune models for domain-specific use cases, such as personalized recommendations, scientific research, or custom automation workflows.
